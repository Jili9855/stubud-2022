# Change of design brief
My original idea in the previous design brief was to design a language learning software where the user could look up words using a dictionary and set time tracking to help them more concentration. However, I delete the time tracking idea, I thought if users who want to set study times, I think they may prefer to use them on their mobile phones rather than the web side. Thus, the final web application will be more focus on task management and music player those two features.
